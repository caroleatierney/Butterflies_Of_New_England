# Week-12-Project

### Coding Steps:
- Create a full CRUD application of your choice using an API or JSON Server.
- Use JQuery/AJAX to interact with the API. 
- Use a form to post new entities.
- Build a way for users to update or delete entities.
- Include a way to get entities from the API.
- Use Bootstrap and CSS to style your project.

** Later if I wanted add an array of sub family names with names & images

Instead of a table, look into organizing the students differently with bootstrap:
Card, Accordion, Dropdowns, Popover, Tooltips

Form handling???

-Dups
-required fields



delete works - needs to refresh!
update not working anymore and then need refresh!
