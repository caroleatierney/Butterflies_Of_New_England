                <p>Driving my friend to Logan Airport, after seeing Bruce Springsteen my fifth time, I mentioned that I only saw one butterfly this Summer on the side of the highway. I had just heard at the Marshfield Fair that Monarch Butterflies are now endangered. There are not enough Milkweeds along their migration pasth and this is there only source of food. She mentioned that once one the Vineyard she saw a ton of Monarchs land and within a few minutes they flew off again. While researching this, I cam across this famous Vineyard video. You can click the link to view it.</p>
